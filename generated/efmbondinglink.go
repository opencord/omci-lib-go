// EfmBondingLink (Class ID: #419 / 0x01a3)
//	The EFM bonding link represents a link that can be bonded with other links to form a group. In
//	[IEEE 802.3], a bonding group is known as a PAF and a link is known as a PME. Instances of this
//	ME are created and deleted by the OLT.
//
//	Relationships
//		An instance of this ME may be associated with zero or one instance of an EFM bonding group.
//
//	Attributes
//		Managed Entity Id
//			This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this ME. The two MSBs of the first byte are
//			the bearer channel ID. Excluding the first 2-bits of the first byte, the remaining part of the
//			ME ID is identical to that of this ME's parent PPTP xDSL UNI part 1.
//
//			NOTE - This attribute has the same meaning as the Stream ID in clause C.3.1.2 of [ITU-T
//			G.998.2], except that it cannot be changed. (R, setbycreate) (mandatory) (2-bytes)
//
//		Associated Group Me Id
//			This attribute is the ME ID of the bonding group to which this link is associated. Changing this
//			attribute moves the link from one group to another. Setting this attribute to an ME ID that has
//			not yet been provisioned will result in this link being placed in a single-link group that
//			contains only this link. The default value for this attribute is the null pointer, 0xFFFF.
//			(R,-W, setbycreate) (mandatory) (2-bytes)
//
//		Link Alarm Enable
//			This bit mapped attribute enables the group down and group partial alarms. A bit value of 1
//			means "enable".
//
//			Bit	Meaning
//
//			1 (LSB)	Link down
//
//			2-8	Reserved
//
//			(R,-W, setbycreate) (mandatory) (1-bytes)
