// PhysicalPathTerminationPointReUni (class ID #314)
//	This ME represents an S'/R' interface in a mid-span PON RE that supports OEO regeneration in at
//	least one direction, where physical paths terminate and physical path level functions are
//	performed (transmit or receive).
//
//	Such an RE automatically creates an instance of this ME for each S'/R' interface port as
//	follows.
//
//	o	When the RE has mid-span PON RE UNI interface ports built into its factory configuration.
//
//	o	When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of the mid-span PON RE UNI type.
//
//	o	When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of the midspan
//	PON RE UNI type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of
//	a mid-span PON RE UNI port via equipment ID as well as its type attribute, and indeed may cause
//	the management ONU to instantiate a port-mapping package to specify the ports precisely.
//
//	The management ONU automatically deletes instances of this ME when a cardholder is neither
//	provisioned to expect a mid-span PON RE UNI circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a mid-span PON
//	RE UNI circuit pack.
//
//	As illustrated in Figure 8.2.10-3, a PPTP RE UNI may share the physical port with an RE upstream
//	amplifier. The ONU declares a shared configuration through the port-mapping package combined
//	port table, whose structure defines one ME as the master. It is recommended that the PPTP RE UNI
//	be the master, with the RE upstream amplifier as a secondary ME.
//
//	The administrative state, operational state and ARC attributes of the master ME override similar
//	attributes in secondary MEs associated with the same port. In the secondary ME, these attributes
//	are present, but cause no action when written and have undefined values when read. The RE
//	upstream amplifier should use its provisionable upstream alarm thresholds and should declare
//	upstream alarms as necessary; other isomorphic alarms should be declared by the PPTP RE UNI. The
//	test action should be addressed to the master ME.
//
//	Relationships
//		An instance of this ME is associated with each instance of a mid-span PON RE S'/R' physical
//		interface of an RE that includes OEO regeneration in either direction, and it may also be
//		associated with an RE upstream amplifier.
//
//	Attributes
//		Managed Entity Id
//			NOTE 1 - This ME ID may be identical to that of an RE upstream amplifier if it shares the same
//			physical slot and port.
//
//		Administrative State
//			NOTE 2 - Administrative lock of a PPTP RE UNI results in loss of signal to any downstream ONUs.
//
//		Operational State
//			Operational state: This attribute indicates whether the ME is capable of performing its
//			function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1). (R) (optional) (1-byte)
//
//		Arc
//			ARC:	See clause A.1.4.3. (R,-W) (optional) (1-byte)
//
//		Arc Interval
//			ARC interval: See clause A.1.4.3. (R,-W) (optional) (1-byte)
//
//		Re Ani_G Pointer
//			RE ANI-G pointer: This attribute points to an RE ANI-G instance. (R,-W) (mandatory) (2-bytes)
//
//		Total Optical Receive Signal Level Table
//			Total optical receive signal level table: This table attribute reports a series of measurements
//			of time averaged received upstream optical signal power. The measurement circuit should have a
//			temporal response similar to a simple 1-pole low pass filter, with an effective time constant of
//			the order of a GTC frame time. Each table entry has a 2-byte frame counter field (most
//			significant end), and a 2-byte power measurement field. The frame counter field contains the
//			least significant 16-bits of the superframe counter received closest to the time of the
//			measurement. The power measurement field is a 2s complement integer referred to 1-mW (i.e.,
//			dBm), with 0.002-dB granularity. The RE equipment should add entries to this table as frequently
//			as is reasonable. The RE should clear the table once it is read by the OLT. (R) (optional) (4-*
//			N-bytes, where N is the number of measurements present.)
//
//		Per Burst Receive Signal Level Table
//			Per burst receive signal level table: This table attribute reports the most recent measurement
//			of received burst upstream optical signal power. Each table entry has a 2-byte ONU-ID field
//			(most significant end), and a 2-byte power measurement field. The power measurement field is a
//			2s complement integer referred to 1-mW (i.e.,-dBm), with 0.002-dB granularity. (R) (optional)
//			(4-* N-bytes, where N is the number of distinct ONUs connected to the S'/R' interface.)
//
//		Lower Receive Optical Threshold
//			Lower receive optical threshold: This attribute specifies the optical level that the RE uses to
//			declare the burst mode low received optical power alarm. Valid values are  -127-dBm (coded as
//			254) to 0-dBm (coded as 0) in 0.5-dB increments. The default value 0xFF selects the RE's
//			internal policy. (R,-W) (optional) (1-byte)
//
//		Upper Receive Optical Threshold
//			Upper receive optical threshold: This attribute specifies the optical level that the RE uses to
//			declare the burst mode high optical power alarm. Valid values are  -127-dBm (coded as 254) to
//			0-dBm (coded as 0) in 0.5-dB increments. The default value 0xFF selects the RE's internal
//			policy. (R,-W) (optional) (1-byte)
//
//		Transmit Optical Level
//			Transmit optical level: This attribute reports the current measurement of the downstream mean
//			optical launch power. Its value is a 2s complement integer referred to 1-mW (i.e., dBm), with
//			0.002-dB granularity. (R) (optional) (2-bytes)
//
//		Lower Transmit Power Threshold
//			Lower transmit power threshold: This attribute specifies the downstream minimum mean optical
//			launch power at the S'/R' interface that the RE uses to declare the low transmit optical power
//			alarm. Its value is a 2s complement integer referred to 1-mW (i.e., dBm), with 0.5-dB
//			granularity. The default value 0x7F selects the RE's internal policy. (R,-W) (optional) (1-byte)
//
//		Upper Transmit Power Threshold
//			Upper transmit power threshold: This attribute specifies the downstream maximum mean optical
//			launch power at the S'/R' interface that the RE uses to declare the high transmit optical power
//			alarm. Its value is a 2s complement integer referred to 1-mW (i.e., dBm), with 0.5-dB
//			granularity. The default value 0x7F selects the RE's internal policy. (R,-W) (optional) (1-byte)
//
//		A Dditional Preamble
//			Additional preamble: This attribute indicates the number of bytes of PLOu preamble that are
//			unavoidably consumed while passing the RE. (R) (mandatory) (1-byte)
//
//		A Dditional Guard Time
//			Additional guard time: This attribute indicates the number of bytes of extra guard time that are
//			needed to ensure correct operation with the RE. (R) (mandatory) (1-byte)
//
