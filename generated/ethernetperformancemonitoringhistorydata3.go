// EthernetPerformanceMonitoringHistoryData3 (Class ID: #296 / 0x0128)
//	This ME collects PM data associated with an Ethernet interface. It includes parameters defined
//	in the Ethernet statistics group of [IETF RFC 2819] that are not already covered by previously
//	defined Ethernet monitoring MEs. The received direction is from the CPE towards the network
//	(upstream).
//
//	NOTE 1 - Several of the same counters are available from the Ethernet frame PM history data MEs,
//	which are associated with MAC bridge ports. MAC bridge port association allows those MEs to be
//	used for any Ethernet flow, in both upstream and downstream directions, while the Ethernet PM
//	history data 3 ME can only be used on a physical IEEE 802.3 port.
//
//	Instances of this ME are created and deleted by the OLT.
//
//	For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.4.
//
//	NOTE 2 - Implementers are encouraged to consider the Ethernet frame extended PM ME defined in
//	clause-9.3.32, which collects the same counters in a more generalized way.
//
//	Relationships
//		An instance of this ME is associated with an instance of the PPTP Ethernet UNI.
//
//	Attributes
//		Managed Entity Id
//			This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this ME. Through an identical ID, this ME is
//			implicitly linked to an instance of the PPTP Ethernet UNI. (R, setbycreate) (mandatory)
//			(2-bytes)
//
//		Interval End Time
//			This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-min interval. (R) (mandatory) (1-byte)
//
//		Threshold Data 1_2 Id
//			Threshold data 1/2 ID: This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 ME that
//			contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold
//			data 2 ME is optional. (R,-W, setbycreate) (mandatory) (2-bytes)
//
//		Drop Events
//			The total number of events in which packets were dropped due to a lack of resources. This is not
//			necessarily the number of packets dropped; it is the number of times this event was detected.
//			(R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Octets
//			The total number of octets received from the CPE, including those in bad packets, excluding
//			framing bytes, but including FCS. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Packets
//			The total number of packets received, including bad packets, broadcast packets and multicast
//			packets. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Broadcast Packets
//			The total number of received good packets directed to the broadcast address. This does not
//			include multicast packets. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Multicast Packets
//			The total number of received good packets directed to a multicast address. This does not include
//			broadcast packets. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Undersize Packets
//			The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets long, but were otherwise well
//			formed (excluding framing bits, but including FCS). (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Fragments
//			The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets long, excluding framing bits
//			but including FCS octets, and had either a bad FCS with an integral number of octets (FCS error)
//			or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (alignment error). It is entirely normal for
//			this attribute to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences
//			due to collisions) and noise hits. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Jabbers
//			The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets, excluding framing bits
//			but including FCS octets, and had either a bad FCS with an integral number of octets (FCS error)
//			or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (alignment error). The range to detect jabber
//			is between 20 ms and 150 ms. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Packets 64 Octets
//			The total number of received packets (including bad packets) that were 64-octets long, excluding
//			framing bits but including FCS. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Packets 65 To 127 Octets
//			The total number of received packets (including bad packets) that were 65..127 octets long,
//			excluding framing bits but including FCS. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Packets 128 To 255 Octets
//			The total number of packets (including bad packets) received that were 128..255 octets long,
//			excluding framing bits but including FCS. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Packets 256 To 511 Octets
//			The total number of packets (including bad packets) received that were 256..511 octets long,
//			excluding framing bits but including FCS. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Packets 512 To 1023 Octets
//			The total number of packets (including bad packets) received that were 512..1023 octets long,
//			excluding framing bits but including FCS. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
//
//		Packets 1024 To 1518 Octets
//			The total number of packets (including bad packets) received that were 1024..1518 octets long,
//			excluding framing bits but including FCS. (R) (mandatory) (4-bytes)
