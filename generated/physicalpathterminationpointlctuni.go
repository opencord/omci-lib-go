// PhysicalPathTerminationPointLctUni (Class ID: #83 / 0x0053)
//	This ME models debug access to the ONU from any physical or logical port, for example, via a
//	dedicated LCT UNI, via ordinary subscriber UNIs, or via the IP host config ME.
//
//	The ONU automatically creates an instance of this ME per port:
//
//	o	when the ONU has an LCT port built into its factory configuration;
//
//	o	when a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of the LCT type;
//
//	o	when a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of the LCT
//	type;
//
//	NOTE - The installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of LCT ports via
//	equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONU to instantiate a port-mapping
//	package that specifies LCT ports.
//
//	o	when the ONU supports debug access through some other physical or logical means.
//
//	The ONU automatically deletes an instance of this ME when a cardholder is neither provisioned to
//	expect an LCT circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an LCT circuit pack, or if the ONU is
//	reconfigured in such a way that it no longer supports debug access.
//
//	LCT instances are not reported during an MIB upload.
//
//	Relationships
//		An instance of this ME is associated with an instance of a real or virtual circuit pack ME
//		classified as an LCT type. An instance of this ME may also be associated with the ONU as a
//		whole, if the ONU supports debug access through means other than a dedicated physical LCT port.
//
//	Attributes
//		Managed Entity Id
//			This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this ME. This 2-byte number indicates the
//			physical position of the UNI. The first byte is the slot ID (defined in clause 9.1.5). The
//			second byte is the port ID, with the range 1..255. If the LCT UNI is associated with the ONU as
//			a whole, its ME ID should be 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
//
//		Administrative State
//			This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this ME. Administrative
//			state is described generically in clause-A.1.6. The LCT has additional administrative state
//			behaviour. When the administrative state is set to lock, debug access through all physical or
//			logical means is blocked, except that the operation of a possible ONU remote debug ME is not
//			affected. Administrative lock of ME instance 0 overrides administrative lock of any other PPTP
//			LCT UNIs that may exist. (R, W) (mandatory) (1-byte)
//
