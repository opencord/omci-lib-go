// NetworkAddress (Class ID: #137 / 0x0089)
//	The network address ME associates a network address with security methods required to access a
//	server. It is conditionally required for ONUs that support VoIP services. The address may take
//	the form of a URL, a fully qualified path or IP address represented as an ACII string.
//
//	If a non-OMCI interface is used to manage VoIP signalling, this ME is unnecessary.
//
//	Instances of this ME are created and deleted by the OLT or the ONU, depending on the method used
//	and case.
//
//	Relationships
//		Any ME that requires a network address may link to an instance of this ME.
//
//	Attributes
//		Managed Entity Id
//			This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this ME. Instances of this ME created
//			autonomously by the ONU have IDs in the range 0..0x7FFF. Instances created by the OLT have IDs
//			in the range 0x8000..0xFFFE. The value 0xFFFF is reserved. (R, setbycreate) (mandatory)
//			(2-bytes)
//
//		Security Pointer
//			This attribute points to an authentication security method ME. The authentication security
//			method indicates the username and password to be used when retrieving the network address
//			indicated by this ME. A null pointer indicates that security attributes are not defined for this
//			network address. (R,-W, setbycreate) (mandatory) (2-bytes)
//
//		Address Pointer
//			This attribute points to the large string ME that contains the network address. It may contain a
//			fully qualified domain name, URI or IP address. The URI may also contain a port identifier
//			(e.g., "x.y.z.com:5060"). A null pointer indicates that no network address is defined. (R,-W,
//			setbycreate) (mandatory) (2-bytes)
//
